# 1.0 CONTEXT

Airbnb is an American vacation rental online marketplace company based in San Francisco, California. Airbnb maintains and hosts a marketplace, accessible to consumers on its website or app. Users can arrange lodging, primarily homestays, and tourism experiences or list their spare rooms, properties, or part of it for rental. On the other hand, users who are traveling are looking for stays search properties and rooms by neighborhood or location. Airbnb recommends the best price in the neighborhood and users book the best deal.

I got a chance to analyze Airbnb listings of Athens city. Athens Airbnb listings dataset has various features such as neighborhood, property_type, bedrooms, bathrooms, price, reviews, ratings, etc. It would be interesting to see what features are affecting the price in Boston city and draw interesting conclusions. I would be more interested in training and evaluating the model and to see how the model has performed while predicting the prices in Athens city at Airbnb.

**Goals:**

**1** - How do features affect the price of listings?

**2** - Can we predict the price of a listing in Athens Airbnb?
